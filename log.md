08:45: Sit down to work.

According to my CV, my distinguishing strength is that I'm able to meaningfully
work full-stack. I will therefore focus on the end-to-end workflow, with the
following milestones:

 1. Basic client-side
 2. Server side, serving the client-side
 3. Some state changes, some way to transfer messages between different client
    sessions. Will probably require manual refresh.
 4. Web Sockets for signalling

Then, I might consider some of these stretch goals:
 * User IDs/names
 * Support for different rooms/direct messages between users
 * Storage backend (SQLite)
